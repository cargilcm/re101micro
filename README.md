This is a fork of @zyedidia's micro but i may eventually repurpose it to the end of creating a regex101.com TUI app using micro as the basis.

Currently <code>make build</code> generates ./micro program which when run will only work with two filenames passed as command arguments b/c it attempts to open one and close the second as bufpane(s)
